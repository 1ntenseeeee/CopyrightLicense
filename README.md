https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-custom-functions#yolov4-custom-functions	

A wide range of custom functions for YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv3, and YOLOv3-tiny implemented in TensorFlow, TFLite and TensorRT.

DISCLAIMER: This repository is very similar to my repository: tensorflow-yolov4-tflite.
I created this repository to explore coding custom functions to be implemented with YOLOv4, 
and they may worsen the overal speed of the application and make it not optimized in respect to time complexity.
So if you want to run the most optimal YOLOv4 code with TensorFlow than head over to my other repository. 
This one is to explore cool customizations and applications that can be created using YOLOv4!
